					<p>This talk will cover (1) the history
of Apache Kafka:  why was it invented and the initial design; (2) a few use
cases of Kafka: how is Kafka being used to transform the business in different
industries; (3) the future of Kafka: the areas that we are working on to build
an event-driven platform.  </p>

                                        <h4>The Materialize Incremental View Maintenance Engine</h4>

                                        <p>I'll describe the incremental view engine in production at Materialize,
                                        Inc., based on timely and differential dataflow. While Materialize is initially
                                        aimed at maintaining traditional SQL queries, the underlying technology
                                        supports a rich variety of declarative, data-parallel query languages, ranging
                                        up through Datalog, graph query languages, interactive visualizations, and
                                        beyond. I'll detail the underlying architecture that supports these varied
                                        idioms, as well as the technology that give Materialize access to execution
                                        plans unavailable to other scale-out streams processors.  </p>

                                        Frank McSherry is Chief Scientist at Materialize, Inc. Frank shared the Godel
                                        prize for the invention of differential privacy, the TCC test of time award for
                                        its theoretical development, and the SIGMOD test of time award for its initial
                                        implementation. He led the award-winning Naiad project at Microsoft Research,
                                        which led to the invention of timely and differential dataflow. Frank's laptop
                                        is similarly accomplished.
