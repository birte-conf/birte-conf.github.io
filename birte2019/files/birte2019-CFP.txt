DESCRIPTION

The BIRTE workshop brings together researchers and practitioners interested in the different facets of real-time business intelligence and real-time analytics, from data acquisition, to processing, to transformation and analysis, to data visualization. Participants will have the opportunity to present their current work in the context of real problems to which they have applied their solutions, innovations and infrastructure and discuss challenges, opportunities and advances in this field. At the same time, as with any other workshop, it will provide the right environment to network with people working on the workshop topics, fostering future collaboration and the consolidation of a solid community that sets the path towards the future of this increasingly important field.

-Tuning and management of the real-time data warehouses
-Integration of real-time, historical, and transactional data
-Data ingestion and capture in real-time
-Visualizing real-time data and information
-Case studies and experience (lessons, pitfalls, guidelines) from real-time BI practice

We call for research, industrial, position, and demo submissions covering these topics of interest. Papers describing real-time BI/real-time analytics systems, platforms, and applications are especially welcome.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

The online proceedings will be published by ACM ICPS. The length of research and industrial papers should not exceed 10 pages, whereas the maximum page limit for position papers and demo papers are 6 and 3 pages, respectively. Papers in PDF should be submitted electronically to the review web site at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/BIRTE2019.
