BIRTE 2017 aims at providing an opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentoring from established researchers. Towards this, with the support of U.S. National Science Foundation and Google, the workshop will provide a limited number of scholarship awards and free early registrations to students attending the BIRTE 2017 Workshop. Priority will be given to students authors who submitted a paper to the workshop, students from underrepresented groups and those attending BIRTE for the very first time.

The free registration entitles the student to attend in the BIRTE workshop and VLDB (plus any workshop on Friday). All applicants need to be full-time students (undergraduate or graduate) and need to attend all the BIRTE workshop sessions. 

The scholarships will include up to $1000 support for traveling in addition to the registration and will be available in the form of reimbursements that are sent only after the completion of the workshop and submission of all required documentation and receipts.  Awardees will have to make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation.
