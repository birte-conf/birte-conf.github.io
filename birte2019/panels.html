				<h3>
                                        Internet of Things (IoT): <br>The future of Real-Time Business Intelligence and Analytics
				</h3>
				<br /> <br />
				<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
The BIRTE workshop has been focusing on the topic of Real-Time Business Intelligence and Analytics for the past 13 years, mainly covering technologies to enable data analysis and infer business intelligence from structured and semi-structured sources of data.  With the new advent of sensor technologies and pervasiveness of IoT devices, more and more businesses collect their data from these new sources in the forms of signals, video and audio.  Our database community has been a pioneer in managing and analyzing these unstructured datasets, representing them as timeseries, multidimensional, streaming and spatiotemporal data types.  Hence, it only seems natural to broaden the scope of BIRTE to advocate our community's participation in the IoT market that according to Forbes  will grow to about $520B in 2021.
</p>
 
<p>
In this panel we discuss different types of IoT datasets and applications, as well as IoT-relevant data management and analysis tools and techniques, and answer the question of whether IoT is only a new application for the old techniques or are there new data management and analytics research and thus a role for our community to play in this growing market.

<h4>David Schrader (Teradata)</h4>
<img src="images/Schrader.jpg" alt="David Schrader" style="width: 160px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;" />
<p>
Since retiring in 2014 as a Director of Database Advanced development and then as a director of Marketing at Teradata, a high-tech database company, "Dr Dave" has remained active on the Board of Directors for the Teradata University Network. In that role he creates materials for faculty and students to learn business analytics, data science, stats, and computer science. After he retired, he gave many Big Data talks, but in 2015 he added sports analytics to his repertoire.  Those talks have become VERY popular.  In the past 3 years, he has given 104 talks to students, faculty, and university staff members on sports and business analytics at 54 schools to more than 3600 people. In May 2018, he was the keynote speaker for the NCAA's first Data Summit, presenting to athletic directors.  Since early 2017, he has focused on helping schools do "Moneyball on Campus" sports projects, connecting athletic departments with students and faculty who can do sports analytics projects on their own campus.  Sample projects include building predictive models for fan attendance at the 12 schools in the Mountain West Conference, a project done with 6 Notre Dame students and 24 Air Force Academy cadets. Another project involved redoing how the NCAA assigns 105 schools to 6 regions on their way to the Division 3 National Wrestling Championships. This project was done with 5 schools: Bentley, Wright State, the University of Cincinnati, Purdue and Notre Dame. Right now he's focused on recruiting pipeline optimization, an area that would save significant time and money at most schools. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue, and worked at 3 different high-tech database companies.
