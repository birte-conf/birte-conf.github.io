				<h3>
					The Need for Speed:<br />Application Necessity, Nice-to-Have or Marketing Fluff?
				</h3>
				<br /> <br />
				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>Real-time and low-latency data analytics receive a lot of attention in both the academic research and industrial worlds, but is faster always better?
					When is "real-time" data processing needed as opposed to "nice to have", irrelevant, or even harmful? What really are the cases where analytics have to
					happen in real-time, and for those applications, does it make sense to have a database or big data software stack in the critical path of processing? When
					can smart use of techniques such as pre-computation and background processing solve the problem?</p>

				<p>Assuming that we can identify important use cases where sophisticated analytics need to be performed immediately and incrementally as data arrives,
					what are the bottlenecks, open research issues, and emerging opportunities for such technology? Finally, what are the answers to the above questions for
					transactional processing, rather than append-only analysis?</p>

				<p>Our distinguished panel bridges academia and industry and represents decades of expertise aimed at addressing the above questions and many others
					(some of which they will likely raise). We look forward to hearing their insights and engaging with the BIRTE participants around these issues, which after
					all, are core to the BIRTE mission.</p>
