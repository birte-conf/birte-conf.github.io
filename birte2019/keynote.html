					<h4>Stream Processing in an Actor-Oriented Database System</h4>

                                        <p>Many of today's near-real-time, server applications are stateful and
                                        processor-intensive. Since their workload is often highly variable, they must
                                        be scalable and elastic. Example applications include multi-player games,
                                        social networking, mobile computing, telemetry, and Internet of Things.  These
                                        applications have stateless front-end processors that feed stateful objects in
                                        the cloud. Usually these objects are backed by key-value cloud storage, rather
                                        than by stored procedures in a database system.  This enables the system to
                                        scale elastically by adding or removing inexpensive middle-tier servers. When
                                        the objects are single-threaded and do not share memory, they are called
                                        actors. There are dozens of programming frameworks for building actor
                                        applications, such as Akka, Erlang, Orbit, and Orleans.  Although these
                                        applications do not use a database system, they can benefit from database
                                        abstractions, such as transactions, indexing, queries, replication,
                                        geo-distribution, and stream processing. We therefore propose a new type of
                                        database system, called an actor-oriented database system (AODB), which
                                        supports these features over middle-tier stateful objects.  As an example
                                        feature, we will discuss how to add stream processing to an AODB. The AODB must
                                        support different stream processing engines and message transports as plug-ins.
                                        It must allow a mix of declarative queries and custom application code and
                                        enable fault-tolerant processing of events. We will explain how these
                                        requirements were met in the stream processing framework of Orleans.</p>

					<h4>Extracting Real-Time Insights from Streaming Data</h4>

                                        <p>Stream data processing is about identifying and responding to events happening in
                                        your business, in your service or application, or with your customers in near real-time.
                                        Sensors, IoT and mobile devices, and online transactions all generate data that can be
                                        monitored constantly to enable a business to detect and then act on events and insights
                                        before they lose their value. The need for large scale, real-time stream processing of
                                        big data in motion is more evident now than ever before. In this talk I will draw upon
                                        our experience with Amazon Kinesis data streaming services to highlight use cases and
                                        dive deep into the role of machine learning over streaming data to extract insights in
                                        real-time.</p>
